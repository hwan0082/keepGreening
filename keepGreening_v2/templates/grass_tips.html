            <p class="col-12">To reduce the environmental impact of my lawn, you can use renewable energy to power an
                electric mower and
                edger. Electric mowers are quieter than fuel ones and, when using clean energy, they eliminate
                pollution.
                Use
                the electric mower when the ground is soft, otherwise mow the lawn with an old hand-propelled mower.</p>
            <h6 class="col-12">How to choose the right lawn</h6>
            <p class="col-12">Successful lawns are a product of the right location, right type of grass and methodical
                maintenance. Like any
                crop, turf needs cultivation. The best lawns are established from scratch, and it's easier and
                preferable to
                replace a poor lawn than to resurrect one.Good maintenance involves paying as much attention to the
                condition of the soil as to the turf itself. Turf is
                superior to seed mixes. Most mixes require cool conditions and regular watering.</p>
            <h6 class="col-12">Best types of grass for Australian gardens</h6>
            <p class="col-12">Choosing the right lawn type for your garden involves considering a wide range of factors,
                including the amount
                of sunlight exposure, weather conditions and your own tendencies as a gardener. The six most reliable
                turf
                grasses for Australian gardens are:
                Common couch, Queensland blue, Durban, Kikuyu, Sir Walter buffalo, and Saltine turf (or saltwater
                couch), as
                well as their cultivars.</p>

            <h6 class="col-12">How to maintain your lawn</h6>
            <p class="col-12">For a successful lawn, you need a regime of mowing, feeding and aerating. Cut at the
                highest
                setting your mower
                permits all year round. This leafy growth helps the lawn to smother and exclude weeds.
                Nourish your lawn by feeding it with granular, organic poultry manure once every three months during the
                growing
                season. Apply it just before rain. Spray with seaweed tonic once a month.
                As well as feeding, ensure the soil pH remains between 6 and 7. Use a pH test kit to check soil every
                autumn,
                which is also the best time to condition soil.
                Use a fork, or mechanical aerator, to break up soil compaction. Aerate in spring and again in autumn to
                help
                water penetration and encourage strong root growth.</p>
            <h6 class="col-12">How to establish a new lawn</h6>
            <p class="col-12">Here are some key points that will help you establish a lawn successfully. Choose or
                create a
                fairly level site,
                where water can soak in, not run off. Turf needs at least three hours of sunshine per day in winter, and
                more in
                summer, so it can grow thick and strong and win out over weeds.</p>
            <div class="col-11 sub-point-container">
                <h6 class="col-12">1. Prepare the soil for grass</h6>
                <p class="col-12">Prepare the soil well by digging it thoroughly and working in plenty of compost or
                    well-rotted animal manures.
                    If necessary, apply gypsum to improve and break up heavy clay.</p>
                <h6 class="col-12">2. Adjust soil's ph level</h6>
                <p class="col-12">Adjust the soil's pH if needed. Turf grasses grow best in soil conditions that are
                    neutral
                    to slightly acidic,
                    with a pH between 6 and 7.</p>
                <h6 class="col-12">3. Weed lawn regularly</h6>
                <p class="col-12">Choose a turf that is suitable for the climate in your area. Control weeds before
                    laying
                    lawn. This may take
                    time with perennial weeds such as creeping oxalis and nutgrass â€“ it took me six months of weekly
                    sprays
                    with an
                    organic herbicide.</p>
                <h6 class="col-12">4. Lay the turf</h6>
                <p class="col-12">Install a mowing strip between the lawn and garden before laying turf. Lay grass as
                    turf
                    and buy quality turves
                    from a professional supplier.</p>
